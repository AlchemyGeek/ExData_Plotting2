# ExData_Plotting2
Project assignment 2 for Coursera "Exploratory Data Analysis" course.

Details for the course can be found in this [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/).

The assignment is the Week 4 final project assignment for the course. 

## Assignment

Details for the assignment can be found in the course assignment page available [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/peer/b5Ecl/course-project-2).

The data being used are included in the repository and are also are available through the course web site and include the following files:

* PM2.5 Emissions Data (`𝚜𝚞𝚖𝚖𝚊𝚛𝚢𝚂𝙲𝙲_𝙿𝙼𝟸𝟻.𝚛𝚍𝚜`): This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year. Here are the first few rows.
* Source Classification Code Table (`𝚂𝚘𝚞𝚛𝚌𝚎_𝙲𝚕𝚊𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚏𝚒𝚌𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗_𝙲𝚘𝚍𝚎.𝚛𝚍𝚜`): This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source. The sources are categorized in a few different ways from more general to more specific and you may choose to explore whatever categories you think are most useful. For example, source “10100101” is known as “Ext Comb /Electric Gen /Anthracite Coal /Pulverized Coal”.

Each R script aims to asnwer 1 of each following questions. The ourput in a PNG image that is also available in the repository:

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
